<p>Wyngz can be a sweet heart of a cat when she has her charm mojo working.  She loves to snuggle<br>
and spend time watching T.V. in the same room as her human care takers and she is quite low<br>
maintenance.  Many cats have the reputation as being loners or non interested in humans though<br>
Wyngz is very much the opposite of that.  She responds to her name and other nick names we have for<br>
her including Wendy, Little Little, Wild Wyngz and Ki Ki Wyngz(short for kitty, kitty, Wyngz).<br>
Our family consists of me and my mother and Wyngz genuinely fits in perfectly.  My mother likes<br>
to pet Wyngz and Wyngz does not mind a pet, even if it is from someone who isn't all cutesy with<br>
animals.  I am more the owner of Wyngz and I constantly pick her up and am petting her so naturally<br>
she is more attached to me.  My mother remarks that Wyngz is just like a little puppy because Wyngz<br>
follows me around the house and comes when I call her.  When we first got Wyngz she was scared the<br>
first few days but she opened up quite quickly.  When she was younger, this being last year, we <br>
had our house tented for termites so we took Wyngz with us on a small vacation to Newport beach.<br>
It was only a matter of minutes before she took to the Air BnB we had rented.  She was walking<br>
around peeking out all the windows and seemed to be enjoying the vacation as much as we did!<br>
Wyngz is really a great pet and I am grateful we were able to rescue her from off the streets<br>
and treat her to the good life of a spoiled indoor cat.</p>
