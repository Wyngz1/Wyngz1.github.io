<p>I could not find the tables from the book so I went online and tried to look up so information on cyber security. 
The top threat according to experts is ransomware attacks. Ransomware attacks have inscreased by 93% in the first half 
of 2021 than in the same period of time the previous year. Next are cloud vulnerabilities, people tend to think by cloud technology
alone you are protected but in reality it takes a robust all around protection to defend from these threats. Phising is a
huge threat still accounting for 36% of security breaches. Social engineering is another big threat because no security system
can defend against the target letting them in. Still patch management is a big security exploit many attackers use, while the 
answer is trying to stay up to date as much as possible. Last is the internet of things, IoT. Many people rely on the convience 
in these systems though not realizing how much of a threat they actualy pose.</p>
