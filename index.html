<p>Hello my name is Sevran Acosta and I am probably one of the old timers in the class. I started at Chaffey College in 2002.  
I am majoring in software engineering and find programming to be a lot of fun. I enjoy blackjack when I have the chance, although 
I was banned from all the MGM Grand casinos on the Las Vegas strip for card counting, though I was not doing that!
I do know how to count cards though I was not counting at the time of this happening. I love to go to Japanese restaurants as Japanese Food is my favorite kind of food.
I know how to play guitar and I have played guitar for 15 years but I have not played in about 10 years. I can not think of much else there is to say about me, thanks for taking 
the time to read this, and good luck in the class. :)</p>
